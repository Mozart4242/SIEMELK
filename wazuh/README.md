## Wazuh
I have created some files to empower [wazuh](https://wazuh.com/) to do more threat hunting.

- **local_rules.xml** is the custome rules for wazuh to detect windows security events with MITRE ATT&CK detection.

- **agent.conf** is the configuration file for wazuh agent that is deployed on your wazuh manager node.

- **siemelk-sysmon.xml** is the [sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) configuration file.
