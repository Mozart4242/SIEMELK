# Stack
The minimum requierments to deploy the stack (Acceptable Performance)is shown in the table below:

| Role   | RAM   |   CPU |
| -------| ------|-------|
| OpenCTI| 8GB | 4  |
|Core service| 12GB | 8 |
|TheHive4| 2GB|1|
|Other| 4GB|2|

24GB of RAM + 2GB extra (Linux and services) = 26 GB of RAM.
14 Cores of CPU is Good to go.

## How to choose your stack?
your stack resources depends on many factors like :

- how many network devices you have?
- how much EPS (Event Per Second) the SIEM should handle?

This table will help you to decide:

| RAM     | CPU     |  DISK | EPS| Entire need|
| --------| ------ |-------|----|----|
|32GB|12|1TB|3000-5000| 40GB RAM|
|48GB|16|2TB|5000-10000|56GB RAM|
|64GB|24|2TB+|10000+|72GB RAM|

⚠️ **NOTE: The Netflow module requiers a very good performance of your machine. (SSD Disks are recommended)**
